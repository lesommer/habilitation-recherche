    "abstract": "  Efficient simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow is a long standing problem in applied mathematics, for which state-of-the-art methods require large compute resources. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach that leverages the approximation power of deep-learning with the precision of standard solvers to obtain fast and highly realistic simulations. Our method solves the incompressible Euler equations using the standard operator splitting method, in which a large sparse linear system with many free parameters must be solved. We use a Convolutional Network with a highly tailored architecture, trained using a novel unsupervised learning framework to solve the linear system. We present real-time 2D and 3D simulations that outperform recently proposed data-driven methods; the obtained results are realistic and show good generalization properties. ",

    "abstract": "  We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models. ",

    "abstract": "  In the context of science, the well-known adage \"a picture is worth a thousand words\" might well be \"a model is worth a thousand datasets.\" Scientific models, such as Newtonian physics or biological gene regulatory networks, are human-driven simplifications of complex phenomena that serve as surrogates for the countless experiments that validated the models. Recently, machine learning has been able to overcome the inaccuracies of approximate modeling by directly learning the entire set of nonlinear interactions from data. However, without any predetermined structure from the scientific basis behind the problem, machine learning approaches are flexible but data-expensive, requiring large databases of homogeneous labeled training data. A central challenge is reconciling data that is at odds with simplified models without requiring \"big data\".\n  In this work we develop a new methodology, universal differential equations (UDEs), which augments scientific models with machine-learnable structures for scientifically-based learning. We show how UDEs can be utilized to discover previously unknown governing equations, accurately extrapolate beyond the original data, and accelerate model simulation, all in a time and data-efficient manner. This advance is coupled with open-source software that allows for training UDEs which incorporate physical constraints, delayed interactions, implicitly-defined events, and intrinsic stochasticity in the model. Our examples show how a diverse set of computationally-difficult modeling issues across scientific disciplines, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to accelerating the training of physics-informed neural networks and large-eddy simulations, can all be transformed into UDE training problems that are efficiently solved by a single software methodology.

    "abstract": "  This review gives an overview of the development of machine learning in geoscience. A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science.

    "abstract": "  The data-driven recovery of the unknown governing equations of dynamical systems has recently received an increasing interest. However, the identification of the governing equations remains challenging when dealing with noisy and partial observations. Here, we address this challenge and investigate variational deep learning schemes. Within the proposed framework, we jointly learn an inference model to reconstruct the true states of the system from series of noisy and partial data and the governing equations of these states. In doing so, this framework bridges classical data assimilation and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and we show that it generalizes state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, both the inference model and the governing equations embed stochastic components to account for stochastic variabilities, model errors and reconstruction uncertainties. Various experiments on chaotic and stochastic dynamical systems support the relevance of our scheme w.r.t. state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "It was only a matter of time before deep neural networks (DNNs) â deep learning â made their mark in turbulence modelling, or more broadly, in the general area of high-dimensional, complex dynamical systems. In the last decade, DNNs have become a dominant data mining tool for big data applications. Although neural networks have been applied previously to complex fluid flows, the article featured here (Ling , , vol. 807, 2016, pp. 155â166) is the first to apply a true DNN architecture, specifically to Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes turbulence models. As one often expects with modern DNNs, performance gains are achieved over competing state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that DNNs may play a critically enabling role in the future of modelling complex flows.",

    "abstract": "We study stimulated generation â the transfer of energy from balanced flows to existing internal waves â using an asymptotic model that couples barotropic quasi-geostrophic flow and near-inertial waves with vertical structure, where is the vertical wavenumber and is the vertical coordinate. A detailed description of the conservation laws of this vertical-plane-wave model illuminates the mechanism of stimulated generation associated with vertical vorticity and lateral strain. There are two sources of wave potential energy, and corresponding sinks of balanced kinetic energy: the refractive convergence of wave action density into anti-cyclones (and divergence from cyclones); and the enhancement of wave-field gradients by geostrophic straining. We quantify these energy transfers and describe the phenomenology of stimulated generation using numerical solutions of an initially uniform inertial oscillation interacting with mature freely evolving two-dimensional turbulence. In all solutions, stimulated generation co-exists with a transfer of balanced kinetic energy to large scales via vortex merging. Also, geostrophic straining accounts for most of the generation of wave potential energy, representing a sink of 10 %â20 % of the initial balanced kinetic energy. However, refraction is fundamental because it creates the initial eddy-scale lateral gradients in the near-inertial field that are then enhanced by advection. In these quasi-inviscid solutions, wave dispersion is the only mechanism that upsets stimulated generation: with a barotropic balanced flow, lateral straining enhances the wave group velocity, so that waves accelerate and rapidly escape from straining regions. This wave escape prevents wave energy from cascading to dissipative scales.",

    "abstract": "The scattering of inertia-gravity waves by large-scale geostrophic turbulence in a rapidly rotating, strongly stratified fluid leads to the diffusion of wave energy on the constant-frequency cone in wavenumber space. We derive the corresponding diffusion equation and relate its diffusivity to the wave characteristics and the energy spectrum of the turbulent flow. We check the predictions of this equation against numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Boussinesq equations in initial-value and forced scenarios with horizontally isotropic wave and flow fields. In the forced case, wavenumber diffusion results in a wave energy spectrum consistent with as-yet-unexplained features of observed atmospheric and oceanic spectra.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence from both oceanic observations and global-scale ocean model simulations indicate the existence of regions where low-mode internal tidal energy dominates over that of the geostrophic balanced flow. Inspired by these findings, we examine the effect of the first vertical mode inertiaâgravity waves on the dynamics of balanced flow using an idealized model obtained by truncating the hydrostatic Boussinesq equations on to the barotropic and the first baroclinic mode. On investigating the waveâbalance turbulence phenomenology using freely evolving numerical simulations, we find that the waves continuously transfer energy to the balanced flow in regimes where the balanced-to-wave energy ratio is small, thereby generating small-scale features in the balanced fields. We examine the detailed energy transfer pathways in wave-dominated flows and thereby develop a generalized small Rossby number geophysical turbulence phenomenology, with the two-mode (barotropic and one baroclinic mode) quasi-geostrophic turbulence phenomenology being a subset of it. The present work therefore shows that inertiaâgravity waves would form an integral part of the geophysical turbulence phenomenology in regions where balanced flow is weaker than gravity waves.",

    "abstract": "For more than a century it has been known that the abyssal basins of the world ocean are primarily occupied by relatively cold and fresh waters that originate in the Southern Ocean. Their distinguishing characteristics are acquired by exposure of surface and shelf waters to âventilationâ by the polar atmosphere and to the melting and freezing of ice over and near the Antarctic continental shelf. Subsequent mixing with deep water over the continental slope results in âBottom Waterâ that forms the southern sinking limb of the global âThermohaline Circulation.â Over recent decades, oceanographers have wrestled with a variety of bottom water and thermohaline circulation problems, ranging from basic definitions to forcing and formation sites, source components and properties, generation processes and rates, mixing and sinking, pathways and transports. A brief review of these efforts indicates both advances and anomalies in our understanding of Antarctic Bottom Water production and circulation. Examples from ongoing work illustrate increasing interest in the temporal variability of bottom water in relation to climate change.",

    "abstract": "The physical elements of the circulation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are reviewed. A picture of the circulation is sketched by means of recent observations from the WOCE decade. We present and discuss the role of forcing functions (wind stress, surface buoyancy flux) in the dynamical balance of the flow and in the meridional circulation and study their relation to the ACC transport. The physics of form stress at tilted isopycnals and at the ocean bottom are elucidated as central mechanisms in the momentum balance. We explain the failure of the Sverdrup balance in the ACC circulation and highlight the role of geostrophic contours in the balance of vorticity. Emphasis is on the interrelation of the zonal momentum balance and the meridional circulation, the importance of diapycnal mixing and eddy processes. Finally, new model concepts are described: a model of the ACC transport dependence on wind stress and buoyancy flux, based on linear wave theory; and a model of the meridional overturning and the mean density structure of the Southern Ocean, based on zonally averaged dynamics and thermodynamics with eddy parametrization.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the climate system has been revolutionized recently, by the development of sophisticated computer models. The predictions of such models are used to formulate international protocols, intended to mitigate the severity of global warming and its impacts. Yet, these models are not perfect representations of reality, because they remove from explicit consideration many physical processes which are known to be key aspects of the climate system, but which are too small or fast to be modelled. The purpose of this paper is to give a personal perspective of the current state of knowledge regarding the problem of unresolved scales in climate models. A recent novel solution to the problem is discussed, in which it is proposed, somewhat counter-intuitively, that the performance of models may be improved by adding random noise to represent the unresolved processes.",

    "abstract": "Finite computing resources limit the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art global climate simulations to hundreds of kilometres. In neither the atmosphere nor the ocean are small-scale processes such as convection, clouds and ocean eddies properly represented. Climate simulations are known to depend, sometimes quite strongly, on the resulting bulk-formula representation of unresolved processes. Stochastic physics schemes within weather and climate models have the potential to represent the dynamical effects of unresolved scales in ways which conventional bulk-formula representations are incapable of so doing. The application of stochastic physics to climate modelling is a rapidly advancing, important and innovative topic. The latest research findings are gathered together in the Theme Issue for which this paper serves as the introduction.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the ventilation of the southern oceans over the past few decades are examined using ocean measurements of CFC-12 and model simulations. Analysis of CFC-12 measurements made between the late 1980s and late 2000s reveal large-scale coherent changes in the ventilation, with a decrease in the age of subtropical Subantarctic Mode Waters (SAMW) and an increase in the age of Circumpolar Deep Waters. The decrease in SAMW age is consistent with the observed increase in wind stress curl and strength of the subtropical gyres over the same period. A decrease in the age of SAMW is also found in Community Climate System Model version 4 perturbation experiments where the zonal wind stress is increased. This decrease is due to both more rapid transport along isopycnals and the movement of the isopycnals. These results indicate that the intensification of surface winds in the Southern Hemisphere has caused large-scale coherent changes in the ventilation of the southern oceans.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we analyze the impacts of climate change on Antarctic marine ecosystems. Observations demonstrate large-scale changes in the physical variables and circulation of the Southern Ocean driven by warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and a positive Southern Annular Mode. Alterations in the physical environment are driving change through all levels of Antarctic marine food webs, which differ regionally. The distributions of key species, such as Antarctic krill, are also changing. Differential responses among predators reflect differences in species ecology. The impacts of climate change on Antarctic biodiversity will likely vary for different communities and depend on species range. Coastal communities and those of sub-Antarctic islands, especially range-restricted endemic communities, will likely suffer the greatest negative consequences of climate change. Simultaneously, ecosystem services in the Southern Ocean will likely increase. Such decoupling of ecosystem services and endemic species will require consideration in the management of human activities such as fishing in Antarctic marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Long-term trends in the heat content of the Southern Hemisphere ocean are evaluated by comparing temperature profiles collected during the 1990s with profiles collected starting in the 1930s. Data are drawn both from ship-based hydrographic surveys and from autonomous floats. Results show that the upper 1000 m of the Southern Hemisphere ocean has warmed substantially during this time period at all depths. Warming is concentrated within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). On a global scale, this warming trend implies that the ocean has gained heat from the atmosphere over the last 50 to 70 years. Although the data do not preclude the possibility that the Southern Ocean has warmed as a result of increased heat fluxes, either into the ocean or within the ocean, in general the strong trend in the Southern Ocean appears regionally consistent with a poleward migration of the ACC, possibly driven by long-term poleward shifts in the winds of the region, as represented by the southern annular mode.",

    "abstract": "Warming and freshening of abyssal waters in the eastern Indian Ocean between 1994/95 and 2007 are quantified using data from two closely sampled high-quality occupations of a hydrographic section extending from Antarctica northward to the equator. These changes are limited to abyssal waters in the Princess Elizabeth Trough and the AustralianâAntarctic Basin, with little abyssal change evident north of the Southeast Indian Ridge. As in previous studies, significant cooling and freshening is observed in the bottom potential temperatureâsalinity relations in these two southern basins. In addition, analysis on pressure surfaces shows abyssal warming of about 0.05Â°C and freshening of about 0.01 Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78) in the Princess Elizabeth Trough, and warming of 0.1Â°C with freshening of about 0.005 in the abyssal AustralianâAntarctic Basin. These 12-yr differences are statistically significant from zero at 95% confidence intervals over the bottom few to several hundred decibars of the water column in both deep basins. Both warming and freshening reduce the density of seawater, contributing to the vertical expansion of the water column. The changes below 3000 dbar in these basins suggest local contributions approaching 1 and 4 cm of sea level rise, respectively. Transient tracer data from the 2007 occupation qualitatively suggest that the abyssal waters in the two southern basins exhibiting changes have significant components that have been exposed to the ocean surface within the last few decades, whereas north of the Southeast Indian Ridge, where changes are not found, the component of abyssal waters that have undergone such ventilation is much reduced.",

    "abstract": "This is the last of a suite of three papers about the transition that occurs in numerical simulations for an idealized equilibrium, subtropical, eastern-boundary upwelling current system similar to the California Current. The transition is mainly explained by the emergence of ubiquitous submesoscale density fronts and ageostrophic circulations about them in the weakly stratified surface boundary layer. Here the high-resolution simulations are further analyzed from the perspective of the kinetic energy (KE) spectrum shape and spectral energy fluxes in the mesoscale-to-submesoscale range in the upper ocean. For wavenumbers greater than the mesoscale energy peak, there is a submesoscale power-law regime in the spectrum with an exponent close to â2. In the KE balance an important conversion from potential to kinetic energy takes place at all wavenumbers in both mesoscale and submesoscale ranges; this conversion is the energetic counterpart of the vertical restratification flux and frontogenesis discussed in the earlier papers. A significant forward cascade of KE occurs in the submesoscale range en route to dissipation at even smaller scales. This is contrary to the inverse energy cascade of geostrophic turbulence and it is, in fact, fundamentally associated with the horizontally divergent (i.e., ageostrophic) velocity component. The submesoscale dynamical processes of frontogenesis, frontal instability, and breakdown of diagnostic force balance are all essential elements of the energy cycle of potential energy conversion and forward KE cascade.",

It is hypothesized that the strength of the lower-limb overturning (Î¨) is strongly controlled by the magnitude of abyssal diapycnal mixing (Îº) and that of mesoscale eddy transfer (K). In particular, it is argued that Î¨ â ÎºK. The scaling and associated theory find support in a suite of sensitivity experiments with an idealized ocean general circulation model. This study shows that intense diapycnal mixing is required to close the buoyancy budget of the lower-limb overturning circulation, in contrast to the upper limb, where airâsea buoyancy fluxes can provide the required diabatic forcing.",

    "abstract": "Simulations from a fine-resolution global coupled model, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, version 2.4 (CM2.4), are presented, and the results are compared with a coarse version of the same coupled model, CM2.1, under idealized climate change scenarios. A particular focus is given to the dynamical response of the Southern Ocean and the role played by the eddiesâparameterized or permittedâin setting the residual circulation and meridional density structure. Compared to the case in which eddies are parameterized and consistent with recent observational and idealized modeling studies, the eddy-permitting integrations of CM2.4 show that eddy activity is greatly energized with increasing mechanical and buoyancy forcings, buffering the ocean to atmospheric changes, and the magnitude of the residual oceanic circulation response is thus greatly reduced. Although compensation is far from being perfect, changes in poleward eddy fluxes partially compensate for the enhanced equatorward Ekman transport, leading to weak modifications in local isopycnal slopes, transport by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and overturning circulation. Since the presence of active ocean eddy dynamics buffers the oceanic response to atmospheric changes, the associated atmospheric response to those reduced ocean changes is also weakened. Further, it is hypothesized that present numerical approaches for the parameterization of eddy-induced transports could be too restrictive and prevent coarse-resolution models from faithfully representing the eddy response to variability and change in the forcing fields.",

    "abstract": "The authors evaluate the response of the Southern Ocean to the variability and multidecadal trend of the southern annular mode (SAM) from 1972 to 2001 in a global eddy-permitting model of the DRAKKAR project. The transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is correlated with the SAM at interannual time scales but exhibits a drift because of the thermodynamic adjustment of the model (the ACC transport decreases because of a low renewal rate of dense waters around Antarctica). The interannual variability of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and the ACC transport are uncorrelated, but the EKE decreases like the ACC transport over the three decades, even though meridional eddy fluxes of heat and buoyancy remain stable. The contribution of oceanic eddies to meridional transports is an important issue because a growth of the poleward eddy transport could, in theory, oppose the increase of the mean overturning circulation forced by the SAM. In the authorsâ model, the total meridional circulation at 50Â°S is well correlated with the SAM index (and the Ekman transport) at interannual time scales, and both increase over three decades between 1972 and 2001. However, given the long-term drift, no SAM-linked trend in the eddy contribution to the meridional overturning circulation is detectable. The increase of the meridional overturning is due to the time-mean component and is compensated by an increased buoyancy gain at the surface. The authors emphasize that the meridional circulation does not vary in a simple relationship with the zonal circulation. The model solution points out that the zonal circulation and the eddy kinetic energy are governed by different mechanisms according to the time scale considered (interannual or decadal).",

    "abstract": "The last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations in short-term, medium-range, and seasonal forecasts: operational weather centers now routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to represent model inadequacy better and to improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. Developed initially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations not only provides better estimates of uncertainty, but it is also extremely promising for reducing long-standing climate biases and is relevant for determining the climate response to external forcing. This article highlights recent developments from different research groups that show that the stochastic representation of unresolved processes in the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and cryosphere of comprehensive weather and climate models 1) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate and 2) reduces systematic model bias. We make a case that the use of mathematically stringent methods for the derivation of stochastic dynamic equations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability to accurately simulate weather and climate at all scales. Recent work in mathematics, statistical mechanics, and turbulence is reviewed; its relevance for the climate problem is demonstrated; and future research directions are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Numerical weather prediction and climate models comprise a) a dynamical core describing resolved parts of the climate system and b) parameterizations describing unresolved components. Development of new subgrid-scale parameterizations is particularly uncertain compared to representing resolved scales in the dynamical core. This uncertainty is currently represented by stochastic approaches in several operational weather models, which will inevitably percolate into the dynamical core. Hence, implementing dynamical cores with excessive numerical accuracy will not bring forecast gains, may even hinder them since valuable computer resources will be tied up doing insignificant computation, and therefore cannot be deployed for more useful gains, such as increasing model resolution or ensemble sizes. Here we describe a low-cost stochastic scheme that can be implemented in any existing deterministic dynamical core as an additive noise term. This scheme could be used to adjust accuracy in future dynamical core development work. We propose that such an additive stochastic noise test case should become a part of the routine testing and development of dynamical cores in a stochastic framework. The overall key point of the study is that we should not develop dynamical cores that are more precise than the level of uncertainty provided by our stochastic scheme. In this way, we present a new paradigm for dynamical core development work, ensuring that weather and climate models become more computationally efficient. We show some results based on tests done with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) dynamical core.",

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates in a realistic context the local contributions of direct atmospheric forcing and intrinsic oceanic processes on interannual sea level anomalies (SLAs). A Â¼Â° global oceanâsea ice general circulation model, driven over 47 yr by the full range of atmospheric time scales, is quantitatively assessed against altimetry and shown to reproduce most observed features of the interannual SLA variability from 1993 to 2004. Comparing this simulation with a second driven only by the climatological annual cycle reveals that the intrinsic part of the total interannual SLA variance exceeds 40% over half of the open-ocean area and exceeds 80% over one-fifth of it. This intrinsic contribution is particularly strong in eddy-active regions (more than 70%â80% in the Southern Ocean and western boundary current extensions) as predicted by idealized studies, as well as within the 20Â°â35Â° latitude bands. The atmosphere directly forces most of the interannual SLA variance at low latitudes and in most midlatitude eastern basins, in particular north of about 40Â°N in the Pacific. The interannual SLA variance is almost entirely due to intrinsic processes south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Indian Ocean sector, while half of this variance is forced by the atmosphere north of it. The same simulations were performed and analyzed at 2Â° resolution as well: switching to this laminar regime yields a comparable forced variability (large-scale distribution and magnitude) but almost suppresses the intrinsic variability. This likely explains why laminar ocean models largely underestimate the interannual SLA variance.",

    "abstract": "To refine the understanding of how the Southern Ocean responds to recent intensification of the southern annular mode (SAM), a regional ocean model at two eddy-permitting resolutions was forced with two synthetic interannual forcings. The first forcing corresponds to homogeneously intensified winds, while the second concerns their poleward intensification, consistent with positive phases of the SAM. Resulting wind-driven responses differ greatly between the nearly insensitive Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the more sensitive meridional overturning circulation (MOC). As expected, eddies mitigate the response of the ACC and MOC to poleward-intensified winds. However, transient eddies do not necessarily play an increasing role in meridional transport with increasing resolution. As winds and resolution increase, meridional transport from standing eddies becomes more efficient at balancing wind-enhanced overturning. These results question the current paradigms on the role of eddies and present new challenges for eddy flux parameterization. Results also indicate that spatial patterns of wind anomalies are at least as important as the overall change in intensity in influencing the Southern Oceanâs dynamic response to wind events. Poleward-intensified wind anomalies from the positive trend in the SAM are far more efficient in accelerating the ACC than homogeneous wind anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Freshening and warming of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) between the 1980s and 2000s are quantified, assessing the relative contributions of water-mass changes and isotherm heave. The analysis uses highly accurate, full-depth, ship-based, conductivityâtemperatureâdepth measurements taken along repeated oceanographic sections around the Southern Ocean. Fresher varieties of AABW are present within the South Pacific and south Indian Oceans in the 2000s compared to the 1990s, with the strongest freshening in the newest waters adjacent to the Antarctic continental slope and rise indicating a recent shift in the salinity of AABW produced in this region. Bottom waters in the Weddell Sea exhibit significantly less water-mass freshening than those in the other two southern basins. However, a decrease in the volume of the coldest, deepest waters is observed throughout the entire Southern Ocean. This isotherm heave causes a salinification and warming on isobaths from the bottom up to the shallow potential temperature maximum. The water-mass freshening of AABW in the Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors is equivalent to a freshwater flux of 73 Â± 26 Gt yrâ1, roughly half of the estimated recent mass loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Isotherm heave integrated below 2000 m and south of 30Â°S equates to a net heat uptake of 34 Â± 14 TW of excess energy entering the deep ocean from deep volume loss of AABW and 0.37 Â± 0.15 mm yrâ1 of sea level rise from associated thermal expansion.",

    "abstract": "In global ocean models, the representation of small-scale, high-frequency processes considerably influences the large-scale oceanic circulation and its low-frequency variability. This study investigates the impact of stochastic perturbation schemes based on three different subgrid-scale parameterizations in multidecadal ocean-only simulations with the ocean model NEMO at 1Â° resolution. The three parameterizations are an enhanced vertical diffusion scheme for unstable stratification, the GentâMcWilliams (GM) scheme, and a turbulent kinetic energy mixing scheme, all commonly used in state-of-the-art ocean models. The focus here is on changes in interannual variability caused by the comparatively high-frequency stochastic perturbations with subseasonal decorrelation time scales. These perturbations lead to significant improvements in the representation of low-frequency variability in the ocean, with the stochastic GM scheme showing the strongest impact. Interannual variability of the Southern Ocean eddy and Eulerian streamfunctions is increased by an order of magnitude and by 20%, respectively. Interannual sea surface height variability is increased by about 20%â25% as well, especially in the Southern Ocean and in the Kuroshio region, consistent with a strong underestimation of interannual variability in the model when compared to reanalysis and altimetry observations. These results suggest that enhancing subgrid-scale variability in ocean models can improve model variability and potentially its response to forcing on much longer time scales, while also providing an estimate of model uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the origin and features of interannualâdecadal Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability from several ocean simulations, including a large (50 member) ensemble of global, eddy-permitting (1/4Â°) oceanâsea ice hindcasts. After an initial stochastic perturbation, each member is driven by the same realistic atmospheric forcing over 1960â2015. The magnitude, spatiotemporal scales, and patterns of both the atmospherically forced and intrinsicâchaotic interannual AMOC variability are then characterized from the ensemble mean and ensemble spread, respectively. The analysis of the ensemble-mean variability shows that the AMOC fluctuations north of 40Â°N are largely driven by the atmospheric variability, which forces meridionally coherent fluctuations reaching decadal time scales. The amplitude of the intrinsic interannual AMOC variability never exceeds the atmospherically forced contribution in the Atlantic basin, but it reaches up to 100% of the latter around 35Â°S and 60% in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. The intrinsic AMOC variability exhibits a large-scale meridional coherence, especially south of 25Â°N. An EOF analysis over the basin shows two large-scale leading modes that together explain 60% of the interannual intrinsic variability. The first mode is likely excited by intrinsic oceanic processes at the southern end of the basin and affects latitudes up to 40Â°N; the second mode is mostly restricted to, and excited within, the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. These features of the intrinsic, chaotic variability (intensity, patterns, and random phase) are barely sensitive to the atmospheric evolution, and they strongly resemble the âpure intrinsicâ interannual AMOC variability that emerges in climatological simulations under repeated seasonal-cycle forcing. These results raise questions about the attribution of observed and simulated AMOC signals and about the possible impact of intrinsic signals on the atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Ocean mesoscale eddies are characterized by rotating-like and meandering currents that imprint the low-level atmosphere. Such a current feedback (CFB) has been shown to induce a sink of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere, and consequently to damp the eddy kinetic energy (EKE), with an apparent regional disparity. In a context of increasing model resolution, the importance of this feedback and its dependence on oceanic and atmospheric model resolution arise. Using a hierarchy of quasi-global coupled models with spatial resolutions varying from 1/4Â° to 1/12Â°, the present study shows that the CFB induces a negative wind work at scales ranging from 100 to 1000 km, and a subsequent damping of the mesoscale activity by ~30% on average, independently of the model resolution. Regional variations of this damping range from ~20% in very rich eddying regions to ~40% in poor eddying regions. This regional modulation is associated with a different balance between the sink of energy by eddy wind work and the source of EKE by ocean intrinsic instabilities. The efficiency of the CFB is also shown to be a function of the surface wind magnitude: the larger the wind, the larger the sink of energy. The CFB impact is thus related to both wind and EKE. Its correct representation requires both an ocean model that resolves the mesoscale field adequately and an atmospheric model resolution that matches the ocean effective resolution and allows a realistic representation of wind patterns. These results are crucial for including adequately mesoscale oceanâatmosphere interactions in coupled general circulation models and have strong implications in climate research.",

This thickness-weighted average (TWA) formulation is identical to the unaveraged equations, apart from eddy forcing by the divergence of three-dimensional EliassenâPalm (EP) vectors in the two horizontal momentum equations. These EP vectors are second order in eddy amplitude and, moreover, the EP divergences can be expressed in terms of the eddy flux of the RossbyâErtel potential vorticity derived from the TWA equations of motion. That is, there is a fully nonlinear and three-dimensional generalization of the one- and two-dimensional identities found by Taylor and Bretherton. The only assumption required to obtain this exact TWA formulation is that the buoyancy field is stacked vertically; that is, that the buoyancy frequency is never zero. Thus, the TWA formulation applies to nonrotating stably stratified turbulent flows, as well as to large-scale rapidly rotating flows. Though the TWA formulation is obtained by working on the equations of motion in buoyancy coordinates, the averaged equations of motion can then be translated into Cartesian coordinates, which is the most useful representation for many purposes.",

    "abstract": "An eddy-resolving numerical model of a zonal flow, meant to resemble the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, is described and analyzed using the framework of J. Marshall and T. Radko. In addition to wind and buoyancy forcing at the surface, the model contains a sponge layer at the northern boundary that permits a residual meridional overturning circulation (MOC) to exist at depth. The strength of the residual MOC is diagnosed for different strengths of surface wind stress. It is found that the eddy circulation largely compensates for the changes in Ekman circulation. The extent of the compensation and thus the sensitivity of the MOC to the winds depend on the surface boundary condition. A fixed-heat-flux surface boundary severely limits the ability of the MOC to change. An interactive heat flux leads to greater sensitivity. To explain the MOC sensitivity to the wind strength under the interactive heat flux, transformed Eulerian-mean theory is applied, in which the eddy diffusivity plays a central role in determining the eddy response. A scaling theory for the eddy diffusivity, based on the mechanical energy balance, is developed and tested; the average magnitude of the diffusivity is found to be proportional to the square root of the wind stress. The MOC sensitivity to the winds based on this scaling is compared with the true sensitivity diagnosed from the experiments.",

    "abstract": "The overturning circulation of the Southern Ocean has been investigated using eddying coupled oceanâsea ice models. The circulation is diagnosed in both densityâlatitude coordinates and in depthâdensity coordinates. Depthâdensity coordinates follow streamlines where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is equivalent barotropic, capture the descent of Antarctic Bottom Water, follow density outcrops at the surface, and can be interpreted energetically. In densityâlatitude coordinates, wind-driven northward transport of light water and southward transport of dense water are compensated by standing meanders and to a lesser degree by transient eddies, consistent with previous results. In depthâdensity coordinates, however, wind-driven upwelling of dense water and downwelling of light water are compensated more strongly by transient eddy fluxes than fluxes because of standing meanders. Model realizations are discussed where the wind pattern of the southern annular mode is amplified. In densityâlatitude coordinates, meridional fluxes because of transient eddies can increase to counter changes in Ekman transport and decrease in response to changes in the standing meanders. In depthâdensity coordinates, vertical fluxes because of transient eddies directly counter changes in Ekman pumping.",

    "abstract": "Meridional heat transport (MHT) in the Southern Ocean (SO) and its components are analyzed with two eddy-permitting climate models. The two models present a consistent picture of the MHT response to projected twenty-first-century changes in SO winds. In agreement with a recent analysis based on an ocean data synthesis product, much of the MHT in the SO is found to be due to the time-mean fields of meridional velocity and temperature. The change in the net MHT tends to be small relative to the interannual variability at most SO latitudes. However, both models exhibit significant changes at most latitudes south of 30Â°S in individual components of MHT. A simple framework wherein changes in the eddy and mean heat transports tend to compensate each other is not supported by the authorsâ results. Instead, the MHT response is composed of sizeable contributions from essentially all of the MHT components, with the eddy and mean heat transports often having the same sign.",

    "abstract": "The eddy field in the Southern Ocean offsets the impact of strengthening winds on the meridional overturning circulation and Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport. There is widespread belief that the sensitivities of the overturning and ACC transport are dynamically linked, with limitation of the ACC transport response implying limitation of the overturning response. Here, an idealized numerical model is employed to investigate the response of the large-scale circulation in the Southern Ocean to wind stress perturbations at eddy-permitting to eddy-resolving scales. Significant differences are observed between the sensitivities and the resolution dependence of the overturning and ACC transport, indicating that they are controlled by distinct dynamical mechanisms. The modeled overturning is significantly more sensitive to change than the ACC transport, with the possible implication that the Southern Ocean overturning may increase in response to future wind stress changes without measurable changes in the ACC transport. It is hypothesized that the dynamical distinction between the zonal and meridional transport sensitivities is derived from the depth dependence of the extent of cancellation between the Ekman and eddy-induced transports.",

    "abstract": "Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) fronts, defined as water mass boundaries, have been known to respond to large-scale atmospheric variabilities, especially the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) and El NiÃ±oâSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). Distinct patterns of localized variability in meridional front displacements during 1992â2011 are derived from the analysis of satellite sea surface height data. Major basin-scale differences are found between the southeast Pacific (150Â°â90Â°W) and the southeast Indian (75Â°â150Â°E) sectors of the ACC. Frontal positions in the southeast Pacific show large year-to-year meridional fluctuations, attributed mostly to ENSO and in part SAM, and no apparent seasonal cycles or long-term trends. In contrast, summer (winter) frontal locations in the southeast Indian extend farther to the south (north) of their long-term mean distribution. A southward drift of ACC fronts is indicated over the Indian sector during the past two decades. This long-term shift is not directly related to the atmospheric variabilities, but this is most likely in response to changes in large-scale ocean circulation, in particular to the poleward expansion of the Indian subtropical gyre. The existence of these localized, contrasting variability patterns suggests that a circumpolar-averaging analysis could possibly smooth out a local climate signal, with an emphasis on a basin-scale investigation for climate studies in the Southern Ocean.",

    "abstract": "The influence of wind forcing on variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is investigated using a series of eddy-permitting oceanâsea ice models. At interannual and decadal time scales the ACC transport is sensitive to both the mean strength of westerly winds along the ACC circumpolar path, consistent with zonal momentum balance theories, and sensitive to the wind stresses along the coast of Antarctica, consistent with the âfree modeâ theory of Hughes et al. A linear combination of the two factors explains differences in ACC transport across 11 regional quasi-equilibrium experiments. Repeated single-year global experiments show that the ACC can be robustly accelerated by both processes. Across an ensemble of simulations with realistic forcing over the second half of the twentieth century, interannual ACC transport variability owing to the free-mode mechanism exceeds that due to the zonal momentum balance mechanism by a factor of between 3.5 and 5 to one. While the ACC transport may not accelerate significantly owing to projected increases in along-ACC winds in future decades, significant changes in transport could still occur because of changes in the stress along the coast of Antarctica.",

    "abstract": "Located at the center of the western North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) is not only abundant in mesoscale eddies, but also exhibits prominent submesoscale eddy features. Output from a Â° high-resolution OGCM simulation and a gridded satellite altimetry product are analyzed to contrast the seasonal STCC variability in the mesoscale versus submesoscale ranges. Resolving the eddy scales of &gt;150 km, the altimetry product reveals that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity have a seasonal maximum in May and April, respectively, a weak positive vorticity skewness without seasonal dependence, and an inverse (forward) kinetic energy cascade for wavelengths larger (shorter) than 250 km. In contrast, the submesoscale-resolving OGCM simulation detects that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity both appear in March, a large positive vorticity skewness with strong seasonality, and an intense inverse kinetic energy cascade whose short-wave cutoff migrates seasonally between the 35- and 100-km wavelengths. Using a 2.5-layer, reduced-gravity model with an embedded surface density gradient, the authors show that these differences are due to the seasonal evolution of two concurring baroclinic instabilities. Extracting its energy from the surface density gradient, the frontal instability has a growth time scale of O(7) days, a dominant wavelength of O(50) km, and is responsible for the surface-intensified submesoscale eddy signals. The interior baroclinic instability, on the other hand, extracts energy from the vertically sheared STCC system. It has a slow growth time scale of O(40) days, a dominant wavelength of O(250) km, and, together with the kinetic energy cascaded upscale from the submesoscales, determines the mesoscale eddy modulations.",

    "abstract": "The low-frequency variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is investigated from 2, Â¼Â°, and Â° global oceanâsea ice simulations, with a specific focus on its internally generated (i.e., âintrinsicâ) component. A 327-yr climatological Â¼Â° simulation, driven by a repeated seasonal cycle (i.e., a forcing devoid of interannual time scales), is shown to spontaneously generate a significant fraction R of the interannual-to-decadal AMOC variance obtained in a 50-yr âfully forcedâ hindcast (with reanalyzed atmospheric forcing including interannual time scales). This intrinsic variance fraction R slightly depends on whether AMOCs are computed in geopotential or density coordinates, and on the period considered in the climatological simulation, but the following features are quite robust when mesoscale eddies are simulated (at both Â¼Â° and Â° resolutions); R barely exceeds 5%â10% in the subpolar gyre but reaches 30%â50% at 34Â°S, up to 20%â40% near 25Â°N, and 40%â60% near the Gulf Stream. About 25% of the meridional heat transport interannual variability is attributed to intrinsic processes at 34Â°S and near the Gulf Stream. Fourier and wavelet spectra, built from the 327-yr Â¼Â° climatological simulation, further indicate that spectral peaks of intrinsic AMOC variability (i) are found at specific frequencies ranging from interannual to multidecadal, (ii) often extend over the whole meridional scale of gyres, (iii) stochastically change throughout these 327 yr, and (iv) sometimes match the spectral peaks found in the fully forced hindcast in the North Atlantic. Intrinsic AMOC variability is also detected at multidecadal time scales, with a marked meridional coherence between 35Â°S and 25Â°N (15â30 yr periods) and throughout the whole basin (50â90-yr periods).",

    "abstract": "The abyssal ocean is primarily filled by cold, dense waters formed around Antarctica and collectively referred to as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). At steady state, AABW must be consumed in the ocean interior at the same rate it is produced, but how and where this consumption is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, estimates of abyssal water mass transformation by geothermal heating and parameterized internal waveâdriven mixing are presented. This study uses maps of the energy input to internal waves by tidal and geostrophic motions interacting with topography combined with assumptions about the distribution of energy dissipation to evaluate dianeutral transports induced by breaking internal tides and lee waves. Geothermal transformation is assessed based on a map of geothermal heat fluxes. Under the hypotheses underlying the constructed climatologies of buoyancy fluxes, the authors calculate that locally dissipating internal tides and geothermal heating contribute, respectively, about 8 and 5 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv â¡ 106 m3 sâ1) of AABW consumption (upwelling), mostly north of 30Â°S. In contrast, parameterized lee waveâdriven mixing causes significant transformation only in the Southern Ocean, where it forms about 3 Sv of AABW, decreasing the mean density but enhancing the northward flow of abyssal waters. The possible role of remotely dissipating internal tides in complementing AABW consumption is explored based on idealized distributions of mixing energy. Depending mostly on the chosen vertical structure, such mixing could drive 1 to 28 Sv of additional AABW upwelling, highlighting the need to better constrain the spatial distribution of remote dissipation. Though they carry large uncertainties, these climatological transformation estimates shed light on the qualitative functioning and key unknowns of the diabatic overturning.",

    "abstract": "In this study, it is investigated how ageostrophic dynamics generate an energy flux toward smaller scales. Numerical simulations of baroclinic instability are used with varying dynamical conditions ranging from quasigeostrophic balance to ageostrophic flows. It turns out that dissipation at smaller scales by viscous friction is much more efficient if the flow is dominated by ageostrophic dynamics than in quasigeostrophic conditions. In the presence of ageostrophic dynamics, an energy flux toward smaller scales is observed while energy is transferred toward larger scales for quasigeostrophic dynamics. Decomposing the velocity field into its rotational and divergent components shows that only the divergent velocity component, which becomes stronger for ageostrophic flows, features a downscale flux. Variation of the dynamical conditions from ageostrophic dynamics to quasigeostrophic balanced flows shows that the forward energy flux and therefore the small-scale dissipation decreases as soon as the horizontal divergent velocity component decreases. A functional relationship between the small-scale dissipation and the local Richardson number is estimated. This functional relationship is used to obtain a global estimate of the small-scale dissipation of 0.31 Â± 0.23 TW from a high-resolution realistic global ocean model.

    "abstract": "In studies of ocean mixing, it is generally assumed that small-scale turbulent overturns lose 15%â20% of their energy in eroding the background stratification. Accumulating evidence that this energy fraction, or mixing efficiency Rf, significantly varies depending on flow properties challenges this assumption, however. Here, the authors examine the implications of a varying mixing efficiency for ocean energetics and deep-water mass transformation. Combining current parameterizations of internal wave-driven mixing with a recent model expressing Rf as a function of a turbulence intensity parameter Reb = ÎµÎ½/Î½N2, the ratio of dissipation ÎµÎ½ to stratification N2 and molecular viscosity Î½, it is shown that accounting for reduced mixing efficiencies in regions of weak stratification or energetic turbulence (high Reb) strongly limits the ability of breaking internal waves to supply oceanic potential energy and drive abyssal upwelling. Moving from a fixed Rf = 1/6 to a variable efficiency Rf(Reb) causes Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling induced by locally dissipating internal tides and lee waves to fall from 9 to 4 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv â¡ 106 m3 sâ1) and the corresponding potential energy source to plunge from 97 to 44 GW. When adding the contribution of remotely dissipating internal tides under idealized distributions of energy dissipation, the total rate of Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling is reduced by about a factor of 2, reaching 5â15 Sv, compared to 10â33 Sv for a fixed efficiency. The results suggest that distributed mixing, overflow-related boundary processes, and geothermal heating are more effective in consuming abyssal waters than topographically enhanced mixing by breaking internal waves. These calculations also point to the importance of accurately constraining Rf(Reb) and including the effect in ocean models.",

    "abstract": "The importance of submesoscale instabilities, particularly mixed layer baroclinic instability and symmetric instability, on upper-ocean mixing and energetics is well documented in regions of strong, persistent fronts such as the Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream. Less attention has been devoted to studying submesoscale flows in the open ocean, far from long-term, mean geostrophic fronts, characteristic of a large proportion of the global ocean. This study presents a year-long, submesoscale-resolving time series of near-surface buoyancy gradients, potential vorticity, and instability characteristics, collected by ocean gliders, that provides insight into open-ocean submesoscale dynamics over a full annual cycle. The gliders continuously sampled a 225 km2 region in the subtropical northeast Atlantic, measuring temperature, salinity, and pressure along 292 short (~20 km) hydrographic sections. Glider observations show a seasonal cycle in near-surface stratification. Throughout the fall (SeptemberâNovember), the mixed layer deepens, predominantly through gravitational instability, indicating that surface cooling dominates submesoscale restratification processes. During winter (DecemberâMarch), mixed layer depths are more variable, and estimates of the balanced Richardson number, which measures the relative importance of lateral and vertical buoyancy gradients, depict conditions favorable to symmetric instability. The importance of mixed layer instabilities on the restratification of the mixed layer, as compared with surface heating and cooling, shows that submesoscale processes can reverse the sign of an equivalent heat flux up to 25% of the time during winter. These results demonstrate that the open-ocean mixed layer hosts various forced and unforced instabilities, which become more prevalent during winter, and emphasize that accurate parameterizations of submesoscale processes are needed throughout the ocean.",

    "abstract": "It is generally understood that small-scale mixing, such as is caused by breaking internal waves, drives upwelling of the densest ocean waters that sink to the ocean bottom at high latitudes. However, the observational evidence that the strong turbulent fluxes generated by small-scale mixing in the stratified ocean interior are more vigorous close to the ocean bottom boundary than above implies that small-scale mixing converts light waters into denser ones, thus driving a net sinking of abyssal waters. Using a combination of theoretical ideas and numerical models, it is argued that abyssal waters upwell along weakly stratified boundary layers, where small-scale mixing of density decreases to zero to satisfy the no density flux condition at the ocean bottom. The abyssal ocean meridional overturning circulation is the small residual of a large net sinking of waters, driven by small-scale mixing in the stratified interior above the bottom boundary layers, and a slightly larger net upwelling, driven by the decay of small-scale mixing in the boundary layers. The crucial importance of upwelling along boundary layers in closing the abyssal overturning circulation is the main finding of this work.",

    "abstract": "A method is presented for calculating a complete, numerically closed, mechanical energy budget in a realistic simulation of circulation in a coastalâestuarine domain. The budget is formulated in terms of the âlocalâ available potential energy (APE; Holliday and McIntyre 1981). The APE may be split up into two parts based on whether a water parcel has been displaced up or down relative to its rest depth. This decomposition clearly shows the different APE signatures of coastal upwelling (particles displaced up by wind) and the estuary (particles displaced down by mixing). Because the definition of APE is local in almost the same sense that kinetic energy is, this study may form meaningful integrals of reservoir and budget terms even over regions that have open boundaries. However, the choice of volume to use for calculation of the rest state is not unique and may influence the results. Complete volume-integrated energy budgets over shelf and estuary volumes in a realistic model of the northeast Pacific and Salish Sea give a new way to quantify the state of these systems and the physical forces that influence that state. On the continental shelf, upwelling may be quantified using APE, which is found to have order-one seasonal variation with an increase due to winds and decrease due to mixing. In the Salish Sea estuarine system, the APE has much less seasonal variation, and the magnitude of the most important forcing terms would take over 7 months to fully drain this energy.",

    "abstract": "The effects of internal waves (IWs), externally forced by high-frequency wind, on energy pathways are studied in submesoscale-resolving numerical simulations of an idealized wind-driven channel flow. Two processes are examined: the direct extraction of mesoscale energy by externally forced IWs followed by an IW forward energy cascade to dissipation and stimulated imbalance, a mechanism through which externally forced IWs trigger a forward mesoscale to submesoscale energy cascade to dissipation. This study finds that the frequency and wavenumber spectral slopes are shallower in solutions with high-frequency forcing compared to solutions without and that the volume-averaged interior kinetic energy dissipation rate increases tenfold. The ratio between the enhanced dissipation rate and the added high-frequency wind work is 1.3, demonstrating the significance of the IW-mediated forward cascades. Temporal-scale analysis of energy exchanges among low- (mesoscale), intermediate- (submesoscale), and high-frequency (IW) bands shows a corresponding increase in kinetic energy Ek and available potential energy APE transfers from mesoscales to submesoscales (stimulated imbalance) and mesoscales to IWs (direct extraction). Two direct extraction routes are identified: a mesoscale to IW Ek transfer and a mesoscale to IW APE transfer followed by an IW APE to IW Ek conversion. Spatial-scale analysis of eddyâIW interaction in solutions with high-frequency forcing shows an equivalent increase in forward Ek and APE transfers inside both anticyclones and cyclones.",

    "abstract": "This paper quantifies the impacts of approximations and assumptions in the parameterization of bulk formulas on the exchange of momentum, heat, and freshwater computed between the ocean and atmosphere. An ensemble of sensitivity experiments is examined. Climatologies of wind stress, turbulent heat flux, and evaporation for the period 1982â2014 are computed using SST and surface meteorological state variables from ERA-Interim. Each experiment differs from the defined control experiment in only one aspect of the parameterization of the bulk formulas. The wind stress is most sensitive to the closure used to relate the neutral drag coefficient to the wind speed in the bulk algorithm, which mainly involves the value of the Charnock parameter. The disagreement between the state-of-the-art algorithms examined is typically on the order of 10%. The largest uncertainties in turbulent heat flux and evaporation are also related to the choice of the algorithm (typically 15%) but also emerge in experiments examining approximations related to the surface temperature and saturation humidity. Thus, approximations for the skin temperature and the salt-related reduction of saturation humidity have a substantial impact on the heat flux and evaporation (typically 10%). Approximations such as the use of a fixed air density, sea level pressure, or simplified formula for the saturation humidity lead to errors no larger than 4% when tested individually. The impacts of these approximations combine linearly when implemented together, yielding errors up to 20% over mid- and subpolar latitudes.",

    "abstract": "A seasonally forced 1/12Â° global ocean/sea ice simulation is used to characterize the spatiotemporal inverse cascade of kinetic energy (KE). Nonlinear scale interactions associated with relative vorticity advection are evaluated using cross-spectral analysis in the frequencyâwavenumber domain from sea level anomaly (SLA) time series. This analysis is applied within four eddy-active midlatitude regions having large intrinsic variability spread over a wide range of scales. Over these four regions, mesoscale surface KE is shown to spontaneously cascade toward larger spatial scalesâbetween the deformation scale and the Rhines scaleâand longer time scales (possibly exceeding 10 years). Other nonlinear processes might have to be invoked to explain the longer time scales of intrinsic variability, which have a substantial surface imprint at midlatitudes. The analysis of a fully forced 1/12Â° hindcast shows that low-frequency and synoptic atmospheric forcing barely affects this inverse KE cascade. The inverse cascade is also at work in a 1/4Â° simulation, albeit with a weaker intensity, consistent with the weaker intrinsic variability found at this coarser resolution. In the midlatitude North Pacific, the spatiotemporal cascade transfers KE from high-frequency frontal Rossby waves (FRWs), probably generated by baroclinic instability, toward the lower-frequency, westward-propagating mesoscale eddy (WME) field. The WMEs provide local gradients of potential vorticity that support these short Doppler-shifted FRWs. FRWs have periods shorter than 2 months and might be subsampled by altimetric observations, perhaps explaining why the temporal inverse cascade deduced from high-resolution models and mapped altimeter products can be quite different. The nature of the nonlinear interactions between FRWs and WMEs remains unclear but might involve wave turbulence processes.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the global eddy kinetic energy (EKE) budget in horizontal wavenumber space is analyzed based on 1/10Â° ocean general circulation model simulations. In both the tropical and midlatitude regions, the barotropic energy conversion from background flow to eddies is positive throughout the wavenumber space and generally peaks at the scale ( L ) where EKE reaches its maximum. The baroclinic energy conversion is more pronounced at midlatitudes. It exhibits a dipolar structure with positive and negative values at scales smaller and larger than L , respectively. Surface wind power on geostrophic flow results in a significant EKE loss around L but deposits energy at larger scales. The interior viscous dissipation and bottom drag inferred from the pressure flux convergence act as EKE sink terms. The latter is most efficient at L while the former is more dominant at smaller scales. There is an evident mismatch between EKE generation and dissipation in the spectral space especially at the midlatitudes. This is reconciled by a dominant forward energy cascade on the equator and a dominant inverse energy cascade at the midlatitudes.",

    "abstract": "Simple Eulerian averaging of velocities, density, and tracers at constant position is the most natural way of averaging. However, Eulerian averaging gives incorrect watermass distributions and properties as well as spurious diabatic circulations such as the Deacon cell. Instead of averaging at constant height, averaging along isopycnals removes such fictitious mixing and diabatic circulations. Such isopycnal averaging is normally performed at constant latitude, that is, averaging along isopynals as they heave up and down. As a result, height information is lost and the sea surface becomes much warmer (or lighter) than with simple Eulerian averaging. In fact, averaging can be performed along arbitrarily aligned surfaces. This study considers a particular case in which isopycnal averaging is performed at constant height. Thus, this new isopycnal averaging follows isopycnals as they meander horizontally at constant z. Height information is now retained at the cost of losing latitudinal information. The advantage of this averaging is that it avoids the problem of giving a surface that is too warm. Associated with this new isopycnal averaging, a âverticalâ transport streamfunction in (Ï, z) space can be defined, in analogy to the conventional meridional overturning streamfunction in (y, Ï) space. Here in Part I, this constant-height isopycnal averaging is explained and illustrated in an idealized zonal channel model. In Part II the relationship between the two different isopycnal averagings and the Eulerian mean eddy flux divergence is explored.",

    "abstract": "Sea surface height measurements from satellites reveal the turbulent properties of the South Pacific Ocean surface geostrophic circulation, both supporting and challenging different aspects of geostrophic turbulence theory. A near-universal shape of the spectral kinetic energy flux is found and provides direct evidence of a source of kinetic energy near to or smaller than the deformation radius, consistent with linear instability theory. The spectral kinetic energy flux also reveals a net inverse cascade (i.e., a cascade to larger spatial scale), consistent with two-dimensional turbulence phenomenology. However, stratified geostrophic turbulence theory predicts an inverse cascade for the barotropic mode only; energy in the large-scale baroclinic modes undergoes a direct cascade toward the first-mode deformation scale. Thus if the surface geostrophic flow is predominately the first baroclinic mode, as expected for oceanic stratification profiles, then the observed inverse cascade contradicts geostrophic turbulence theory. The latter interpretation is argued for. Furthermore, and consistent with this interpretation, the inverse cascade arrest scale does not follow the Rhines arrest scale, as one would expect for the barotropic mode. A tentative revision of theory is proposed that would resolve the conflicts; however, further observations and idealized modeling experiments are needed to confirm, or refute, the revision. It is noted that no inertial range was found for the inverse cascade range of the spectrum, implying inertial range scaling, such as the established Kâ5/3 slope in the spectral kinetic energy density plot, is not applicable to the surface geostrophic flow.",

    "abstract": "The spatial and temporal distributions of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are investigated, using monthly data from the NCEPâNCAR reanalysis for the period 1980â2004. Patterns of atmospheric forcing are identified in observations of sea level pressure and airâsea heat fluxes. It is found that a significant fraction of SST variability in the ACC can be understood as a linear response to surface forcing by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and remote forcing by ENSO. The physical mechanisms rely on the interplay between atmospheric variability and mean advection by the ACC. SAM and ENSO drive a low-level anomalous circulation pattern localized over the South Pacific Ocean, inducing surface heat fluxes and Ekman heat advection anomalies. A simple model of SST propagating in the ACC, forced with heat fluxes estimated from the reanalysis, suggests that surface heat fluxes and Ekman heat advection are equally important in driving the observed SST variability. Further diagnostics indicate that SST anomalies, generated mainly upstream of Drake Passage, are subsequently advected by the ACC and damped after a couple of years. It is suggested that SST variability along the path of the ACC is largely a passive response of the oceanic mixed layer to atmospheric forcing.",

    "abstract": "The Modeling Eddies in the Southern Ocean (MESO) project uses numerical sensitivity studies to examine the role played by Southern Ocean winds and eddies in determining the density structure of the global ocean and the magnitude and structure of the global overturning circulation. A hemispheric isopycnal-coordinate ocean model (which avoids numerical diapycnal diffusion) with realistic geometry is run with idealized forcing at a range of resolutions from coarse (2Â°) to eddy-permitting (1/6Â°). A comparison of coarse resolutions with fine resolutions indicates that explicit eddies affect both the structure of the overturning and the response of the overturning to wind stress changes. While the presence of resolved eddies does not greatly affect the prevailing qualitative picture of the ocean circulation, it alters the overturning cells involving the Southern Ocean transformation of dense deep waters and light waters of subtropical origin into intermediate waters. With resolved eddies, the surface-to-intermediate water cell extends farther southward by hundreds of kilometers and the deep-to-intermediate cell draws on comparatively lighter deep waters. The overturning response to changes in the winds is also sensitive to the presence of eddies. In noneddying simulations, changing the Ekman transport produces comparable changes in the overturning, much of it involving transformation of deep waters and resembling the mean circulation. In the eddy-permitting simulations, a significant fraction of the Ekman transport changes are compensated by eddy-induced transport drawing from lighter waters than does the mean overturning. This significant difference calls into question the ability of coarse-resolution ocean models to accurately capture the impact of changes in the Southern Ocean on the global ocean circulation.",

    "abstract": "The energy pathways in geostrophic turbulence are explored using a two-layer, flat-bottom, f-plane, quasigeostrophic model forced by an imposed, horizontally homogenous, baroclinically unstable mean flow and damped by bottom Ekman friction. A systematic presentation of the spectral energy fluxes, the mean flow forcing, and dissipation terms allows for a comprehensive understanding of the sources and sinks for baroclinic and barotropic energy as a function of length scale. The key new result is a robust inverse cascade of kinetic energy for both the baroclinic mode and the upper layer. This is consistent with recent observations of satellite altimeter data over the South Pacific Ocean. The well-known forward cascade of baroclinic potential and total energy was found to be very robust. Decomposing the spectral fluxes into contributions from different terms provided further insight. The inverse baroclinic kinetic energy cascade is driven mostly by an efficient interaction between the baroclinic velocity and the barotropic vorticity, the latter playing a crucial catalytic role. This cascade can be further enhanced by the baroclinic mode self-interaction, which is only present with nonuniform stratification (unequal layer depths). When model parameters are set such that modeled eddies compare favorably with observations, the inverse baroclinic kinetic energy cascade is actually much stronger than the well-known inverse cascade in the barotropic mode. The upper-layer kinetic energy cascade was found to dominate the lower-layer cascade over a wide range of parameters, suggesting that the surface cascade and time mean density stratification may be sufficient for estimating the depth-integrated cascade from ocean observations. This may find useful application in inferring the kinetic to gravitational potential energy conversion rate from satellite measurements.",

    "abstract": "Calculating a streamfunction as function of depth and density is proposed as a new way of analyzing the thermodynamic character of the overturning circulation in the global ocean. The sign of an overturning cell in this streamfunction directly shows whether it is driven mechanically by large-scale wind stress or thermally by heat conduction and small-scale mixing. It is also shown that the integral of this streamfunction gives the thermodynamic work performed by the fluid. The analysis is also valid for the Boussinesq equations, although formally there is no thermodynamic work in an incompressible fluid. The proposed method is applied both to an idealized coarse-resolution three-dimensional numerical ocean model, and to the realistic high-resolution Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Model (OCCAM). It is shown that the overturning circulation in OCCAM between the 200- and 1000-m depth is dominated by a thermally indirect cell of 24 Sverdrups (1 Sv â¡ 106 m3 sâ1), forced by Ekman pumping. In the densest and deepest waters there is a thermally direct cell of 18 Sv, which requires a forcing by around 100 GW of parameterized small-scale mixing.",

    "abstract": "Most data assimilation algorithms require the inverse of the covariance matrix of the observation errors. In practical applications, the cost of computing this inverse matrix with spatially correlated observation errors is prohibitive. Common practices are therefore to subsample or combine the observations so that the errors of the assimilated observations can be considered uncorrelated. As a consequence, a large fraction of the available observational information is not used in practical applications. In this study, a method is developed to account for the correlations of the errors that will be present in the wide-swath sea surface height measurements, for example, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. It basically consists of the transformation of the observation vector so that the inverse of the corresponding covariance matrix can be replaced by a diagonal matrix, thus allowing to genuinely take into account errors that are spatially correlated in physical space. Numerical experiments of ensemble Kalman filter analysis of SWOT-like observations are conducted with three different observation error covariance matrices. Results suggest that the proposed method provides an effective way to account for error correlations in the assimilation of the future SWOT data. The transformation of the observation vector proposed herein yields both a significant reduction of the root-mean-square errors and a good consistency between the filter analysis error statistics and the true error statistics.",

    "abstract": "Because of the irregular sampling pattern of raw altimeter data, many oceanographic applications rely on information from sea surface height (SSH) products gridded on regular grids where gaps have been filled with interpolation. Today, the operational SSH products are created using the simple, but robust, optimal interpolation (OI) method. If well tuned, the OI becomes computationally cheap and provides accurate results at low resolution. However, OI is not adapted to produce high-resolution and high-frequency maps of SSH. To improve the interpolation of SSH satellite observations, a data-driven approach (i.e., constructing a dynamical forecast model from the data) was recently proposed: analog data assimilation (AnDA). AnDA adaptively chooses analog situations from a catalog of SSH scenesâoriginating from numerical simulations or a large database of observationsâwhich allow the temporal propagation of physical features at different scales, while each observation is assimilated. In this article, we review the AnDA and OI algorithms and compare their skills in numerical experiments. The experiments are observing system simulation experiments (OSSE) on the Lorenz-63 system and on an SSH reconstruction problem in the Gulf of Mexico. The results show that AnDA, with no necessary tuning, produces comparable reconstructions as does OI with tuned parameters. Moreover, AnDA manages to reconstruct the signals at higher frequencies than OI. Finally, an important additional feature for any interpolation method is to be able to assess the quality of its reconstruction. This study shows that the standard deviation estimated by AnDA is flow dependent, hence more informative on the reconstruction quality, than the one estimated by OI.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic parameterization provides a methodology for representing model uncertainty in ensemble forecasts. Here the impact on forecast reliability over seasonal time scales of three existing stochastic parameterizations in the ocean component of a coupled model is studied. The relative impacts of these schemes upon the ocean mean state and ensemble spread are analyzed. The oceanic variability induced by the atmospheric forcing of the coupled system is, in most regions, the major source of ensemble spread. The largest impact on spread and bias came from the stochastically perturbed parameterization tendency (SPPT) scheme, which has proven particularly effective in the atmosphere. The key regions affected are eddy-active regions, namely, the western boundary currents and the Southern Ocean where ensemble spread is increased. However, unlike its impact in the atmosphere, SPPT in the ocean did not result in a significant decrease in forecast error on seasonal time scales. While there are good grounds for implementing stochastic schemes in ocean models, the results suggest that they will have to be more sophisticated. Some suggestions for next-generation stochastic schemes are made.",

    "abstract": "The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is a next generation satellite mission expected to provide a 2 km-resolution observation of the sea surface height (SSH) on a two-dimensional swath. Processing SWOT data will be challenging because of the large amount of data, the mismatch between a high spatial resolution and a low temporal resolution, and the observation errors. The present paper focuses on the reduction of the spatially structured errors of SWOT SSH data. It investigates a new error reduction method and assesses its performance in an observing system simulation experiment. The proposed error-reduction method first projects the SWOT SSH onto a subspace spanned by the SWOT spatially structured errors. This projection is removed from the SWOT SSH to obtain a detrended SSH. The detrended SSH is then processed within an ensemble data assimilation analysis to retrieve a full SSH field. In the latter step, the detrending is applied to both the SWOT data and an ensemble of model-simulated SSH fields. Numerical experiments are performed with synthetic SWOT observations and an ensemble from a North Atlantic, 1/60Â° simulation of the ocean circulation (NATL60). The data assimilation analysis is carried out with an ensemble Kalman filter. The results are assessed with root mean square errors, power spectrum density, and spatial coherence. They show that a significant part of the large scale SWOT errors is reduced. The filter analysis also reduces the small scale errors and allows for an accurate recovery of the energy of the signal down to 25 km scales. In addition, using the SWOT nadir data to adjust the SSH detrending further reduces the errors.",

    "abstract": "In the near future, the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will provide images of altimetric data at kilometric resolution. This unprecedented 2-dimensional data structure will allow the estimation of geostrophy-related quantities that are essential for studying the ocean surface dynamics and for data assimilation uses. To estimate these quantities, i.e., to compute spatial derivatives of the Sea Surface Height (SSH) measurements, the uncorrelated, small-scale noise and errors expected to affect the SWOT data must be smoothed out while minimizing the loss of relevant, physical SSH information. This paper introduces a new technique for de-noising the future SWOT SSH images. The de-noising model is formulated as a regularized least-square problem with a Tikhonov regularization based on the first-, second-, and third-order derivatives of SSH. The method is implemented and compared to other, convolution-based filtering methods with boxcar and Gaussian kernels. This is performed using a large set of pseudo-SWOT data generated in the western Mediterranean Sea from a 1/60 â simulation and the SWOT simulator. Based on root mean square error and spectral diagnostics, our de-noising method shows a better performance than the convolution-based methods. We find the optimal parametrization to be when only the second-order SSH derivative is penalized. This de-noising reduces the spatial scale resolved by SWOT by a factor of 2, and at 10 km wavelengths, the noise level is reduced by factors of 10 4 and 10 3 for summer and winter, respectively. This is encouraging for the processing of the future SWOT data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. We report global long-term trends in surface ocean pH using a new pH data set computed by combining fCO2 observations from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) version 2 with surface alkalinity estimates based on temperature and salinity. Trends were determined over the periods 1981â2011 and 1991â2011 for a set of 17 biomes using a weighted linear least squares method. We observe significant decreases in surface ocean pH in ~70% of all biomes and a mean rate of decrease of 0.0018 Â± 0.0004 yrâ1 for 1991â2011. We are not able to calculate a global trend for 1981â2011 because too few biomes have enough data for this. In half the biomes, the rate of change is commensurate with the trends expected based on the assumption that the surface ocean pH change is only driven by the surface ocean CO2 chemistry remaining in a transient equilibrium with the increase in atmospheric CO2. In the remaining biomes, deviations from such equilibrium may reflect that the trend of surface ocean fCO2 is not equal to that of the atmosphere, most notably in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, or may reflect changes in the oceanic buffer (Revelle) factor. We conclude that well-planned and long-term sustained observational networks are key to reliably document the ongoing and future changes in ocean carbon chemistry due to anthropogenic forcing.",

Ensemble simulations with N members running simultaneously within a single executable, and interacting mutually if needed, are made possible through an enhanced message-passing interface (MPI) strategy including a double parallelization in the spatial and ensemble dimensions. An example application is then given to illustrate the implementation, performances, and potential use of this novel probabilistic modelling tool. A large ensemble of 50 global oceanâsea-ice hindcasts has been performed over the period 1960â2015 at eddy-permitting resolution (1â4Â°) for the OCCIPUT (oceanic chaos â impacts, structure, predictability) project. This application aims to simultaneously simulate the intrinsic/chaotic and the atmospherically forced contributions to the ocean variability, from mesoscale turbulence to interannual-to-multidecadal timescales. Such an ensemble indeed provides a unique way to disentangle and study both contributions, as the forced variability may be estimated through the ensemble mean, and the intrinsic chaotic variability may be estimated through the ensemble spread.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Ocean biogeochemical models are key tools for both scientific and operational applications. Nevertheless the cost of these models is often expensive because of the large number of biogeochemical tracers. This has motivated the development of multi-grid approaches where ocean dynamics and tracer transport are computed on grids of different spatial resolution. However, existing multi-grid approaches to tracer transport in ocean modelling do not allow the computation of ocean dynamics and tracer transport simultaneously. This paper describes a new multi-grid approach developed for accelerating the computation of passive tracer transport in the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean circulation model. In practice, passive tracer transport is computed at runtime on a grid with coarser spatial resolution than the hydrodynamics, which reduces the CPU cost of computing the evolution of tracers. We describe the multi-grid algorithm, its practical implementation in the NEMO ocean model, and discuss its performance on the basis of a series of sensitivity experiments with global ocean model configurations. Our experiments confirm that the spatial resolution of hydrodynamical fields can be coarsened by a factor of 3 in both horizontal directions without significantly affecting the resolved passive tracer fields. Overall, the proposed algorithm yields a reduction by a factor of 7 of the overhead associated with running a full biogeochemical model like PISCES (with 24 passive tracers). Propositions for further reducing this cost without affecting the resolved solution are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Ocean biogeochemical models are key tools for both scientific and operational applications. Nevertheless the cost of running these models is often expensive because of the large number of biogeochemical tracers. This has motivated the development of multi-grid approaches where ocean dynamics and tracer transport are computed on grids of different spatial resolution. However, existing multi-grid approaches to tracer transport in ocean modelling do not allow to compute ocean dynamics and tracer transport simultaneously. This paper describes a new multi-grid approach developed for accelerating the computation of passive tracer transport in the NEMO ocean circulation model. In practice, passive tracer transport is computed at runtime on a grid with coarser spatial resolution than the hydrodynamics, which allows to reduce the CPU cost of computing the evolution of tracer. We describe the multi-grid algorithm, its practical implementation in the NEMO ocean model, and discuss its performance on the basis of a series of sensitivity experiments with global ocean model configurations. Our experiments confirm that the spatial resolution of hydrodynamical fields can be coarsened by a factor 3 in both horizontal directions without significantly affecting the resolved passive tracer fields. Overall, the proposed algorithm yields a reduction by a factor 7 of the overhead associated with running a full biogeochemical model like PISCES (with 24 passive tracers). Propositions for reducing further this cost without affecting the resolved solution are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. In this paper, a generic implementation approach is presented, with the aim of transforming a deterministic ocean model (like NEMO) into a probabilistic model. With this approach, several kinds of stochastic parameterizations are implemented to simulate the non-deterministic effect of unresolved processes, unresolved scales and unresolved diversity. The method is illustrated with three applications, showing that uncertainties can produce a major effect in the circulation model, in the ecosystem model, and in the sea ice model. These examples show that uncertainties can produce an important effect in the simulations, strongly modifying the dynamical behaviour of these three components of ocean systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. An established iceberg module, ICB, is used interactively with the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean model in a new implementation, NEMOâICB (v1.0). A 30-year hindcast (1976â2005) simulation with an eddy-permitting (0.25Â°) global configuration of NEMOâICB is undertaken to evaluate the influence of icebergs on sea ice, hydrography, mixed layer depths (MLDs), and ocean currents, through comparison with a control simulation in which the equivalent iceberg mass flux is applied as coastal runoff, a common forcing in ocean models. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), drift and melting of icebergs are in balance after around 5 years, whereas the equilibration timescale for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is 15â20 years. Iceberg drift patterns, and Southern Ocean iceberg mass, compare favourably with available observations. Freshwater forcing due to iceberg melting is most pronounced very locally, in the coastal zone around much of Antarctica, where it often exceeds in magnitude and opposes the negative freshwater fluxes associated with sea ice freezing. However, at most locations in the polar Southern Ocean, the annual-mean freshwater flux due to icebergs, if present, is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the contribution of sea ice melting and precipitation. A notable exception is the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, where iceberg melting reaches around 50% of net precipitation over a large area. Including icebergs in place of coastal runoff, sea ice concentration and thickness are notably decreased at most locations around Antarctica, by up to ~ 20% in the eastern Weddell Sea, with more limited increases, of up to ~ 10% in the Bellingshausen Sea. Antarctic sea ice mass decreases by 2.9%, overall. As a consequence of changes in net freshwater forcing and sea ice, salinity and temperature distributions are also substantially altered. Surface salinity increases by ~ 0.1 psu around much of Antarctica, due to suppressed coastal runoff, with extensive freshening at depth, extending to the greatest depths in the polar Southern Ocean where discernible effects on both salinity and temperature reach 2500 m in the Weddell Sea by the last pentad of the simulation. Substantial physical and dynamical responses to icebergs, throughout the global ocean, are explained by rapid propagation of density anomalies from high-to-low latitudes. Complementary to the baseline model used here, three prototype modifications to NEMOâICB are also introduced and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. The impact of forthcoming wide-swath altimetry missions on the ocean analysis and forecasting system was investigated by means of OSSEs (observing system simulation experiments). These experiments were performed with a regional data assimilation system, implemented in the IberianâBiscayâIreland (IBI) region, at 1â12â resolution using simulated observations derived from a fully eddy-resolving free simulation at 1â36â resolution over the same region. The objective of the experiments was to assess the ability of different satellite constellations to constrain the ocean analyses and forecasts, considering both along-track altimeters and future wide-swath missions; consequently, the capability of the data assimilation techniques used in the Mercator Ocean operational system to effectively combine the different kinds of measurements was also investigated. These assessments were carried out as part of a European Space Agency (ESA) study on the potential role of wide-swath altimetry in future versions of the European Union Copernicus programme. The impact of future wide-swath altimetry data is evident for investigating the reliability of sea level values in OSSEs. The most significant results were obtained when looking at the sensitivity of the system to wide-swath instrumental error: considering a constellation of three nadir and two âaccurateâ (small instrumental error) wide-swath altimeters, the error in ocean analysis was reduced by up to 50 % compared to conventional altimeters. Investigating the impact of the repetitivity of the future measurements, the results showed that two wide-swath missions had a major impact on sea-level forecasting â increasing the accuracy over the entire time window of the 5-day forecasts â compared with a single wide-swath instrument. A spectral analysis underlined that the contributions of wide-swath altimetry data observed in ocean analyses and forecast statistics were mainly due to the more accurate resolution, compared with along-track data, of ocean variability at spatial scales smaller than 100 km. Considering the ocean currents, the results confirmed that the information provided by wide-swath measurements at the surface is propagated down the water column and has a considerable impact (30 %) on ocean currents (up to a depth of 300 m), compared with the present constellation of altimeters. The ocean analysis and forecasting systems used here are those currently used by the Copernicus Marine Environment and Monitoring Service (CMEMS) to provide operational services and ocean reanalysis. The results obtained in the OSSEs considering along-track altimeters were consistent with those derived from real data (observing system experiments, OSEs). OSSEs can also be used to assess the potential of new observing systems, and in this study the results showed that future constellations of altimeters will have a major impact on constraining the CMEMS ocean analysis and forecasting systems and their applications.",

Previous model-based estimates of the meridional circulation were calculated using zonal averages: this method leads to a counter-intuitive poleward circulation of the less dense waters, and underestimates the eddy effects. We show that on the contrary, the upper ocean circulation across streamlines agrees with the theoretical view: an equatorward mean flow partially cancelled by a poleward eddy mass flux. Two model simulations, in which the buoyancy forcing above the ACC changes from positive to negative, suggest that the relationship between the residual meridional circulation and the surface buoyancy flux is not as straightforward as assumed by the simplest theoretical models: the sign of the residual circulation cannot be inferred from the surface buoyancy forcing only. Among the other processes that likely play a part in setting the meridional circulation, our model results emphasize the complex three-dimensional structure of the ACC (probably not well accounted for in streamline-averaged, two-dimensional models) and the distinct role of temperature and salinity in the definition of the density field. Heat and salt transports by the time-mean flow are important even across time-mean streamlines. Heat and salt are balanced in the ACC, the model drift being small, but the nonlinearity of the equation of state cannot be ignored in the density balance.",

(2006) to yield substantial improvements in the surface solution of the DRAKKAR Â¼Â° global sea-ice/ocean model. The present study extends this investigation below the surface with a special focus on the Atlantic and reveals many improvements there as well: e.g. more realistic path, structure and transports of major currents (Gulf Stream, North Atlantic Current, Confluence region, Zapiola anticyclone), behavior of shedded rings, narrower subsurface boundary currents, stronger mean and eddy flows (MKE and EKE) at depth, beneficial enhancement of cyclonic (anticyclonic) flows around topographic depressions (mountains). Interestingly, adding a no-slip boundary condition to this improved model setup cancels most of these improvements, bringing back the biases diagnosed without the improved momentum advection scheme and partial steps (these biases are typical of other models at comparable or higher resolutions). This shows that current-topography interactions and full-depth eddy-admitting model solutions can be seriously deteriorated by near-bottom sidewall friction, either explicit or inherent to inadequate numerical schemes.",

More specifically, satellite passive-microwave data for the period November 1978âDecember 2010 reveal an overall positive trend in ice extents of 17 100 Â± 2300 km2 yrâ1. Much of the increase, at 13 700 Â± 1500 km2 yrâ1, has occurred in the region of the Ross Sea, with lesser contributions from the Weddell Sea and Indian Ocean. One region, that of the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has (like the Arctic) instead experienced significant sea ice decreases, with an overall ice extent trend of â8200 Â± 1200 km2 yrâ1. When examined through the annual cycle over the 32-yr period 1979â2010, the Southern Hemisphere sea ice cover as a whole experienced positive ice extent trends in every month, ranging in magnitude from a low of 9100 Â± 6300 km2 yrâ1 in February to a high of 24 700 Â± 10 000 km2 yrâ1 in May. The Ross Sea and Indian Ocean also had positive trends in each month, while the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas had negative trends in each month, and the Weddell Sea and western Pacific Ocean had a mixture of positive and negative trends. Comparing ice-area results to ice-extent results, in each case the ice-area trend has the same sign as the ice-extent trend, but the magnitudes of the two trends differ, and in some cases these differences allow inferences about the corresponding changes in sea ice concentrations. The strong pattern of decreasing ice coverage in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas region and increasing ice coverage in the Ross Sea region is suggestive of changes in atmospheric circulation. This is a key topic for future research.",

Toutefois de nombreuses incertitudes demeurent quant Ã  l'Ã©volution rÃ©cente du puits de carbone austral notamment en raison du manque d'observations et des lacunes des modÃ¨les ocÃ©aniques dans la reprÃ©sentation de processus dynamiques comme les tourbillons. Depuis quelques dÃ©cennies notamment, l'efficacitÃ© du puits de carbone austral diminuerait en raison d'une intensification des vents liÃ©e Ã  une tendance positive du Mode Annulaire Austral (SAM). L'objectif de ces travaux de thÃ¨se est de dÃ©crire et comprendre la variabilitÃ© spatiale et temporelle rÃ©cente des flux air-mer de CO2 dans l'ocÃ©an Austral. Pour cela, des simulations de sensibilitÃ© aux phases positives du SAM sont rÃ©alisÃ©es dans une configuration rÃ©gionale de l'ocÃ©an Austral (sud de 30Â°S), basÃ©e sur un modÃ¨le couplÃ© dynamique-biogÃ©ochimie forcÃ© par l'atmosphÃ¨re et rÃ©solvant partiellement la mÃ©so-Ã©chelle ocÃ©anique. Dans l'ocÃ©an Austral, la rÃ©ponse des flux de CO2 au SAM correspond Ã  un dÃ©gazage intense de CO2 dans la zone antarctique dÃ» Ã  une augmentation des concentrations de surface de carbone inorganique dissous (DIC). Cette augmentation est pilotÃ©e par la dynamique de la couche de mÃ©lange et alimentÃ©e par un transport mÃ©ridien de DIC qui rÃ©sulte essentiellement de la compÃ©tition entre circulation induite par les vents et par les mÃ©andres stationnaires. Ces travaux montrent l'apport d'une augmentation de la rÃ©solution numÃ©rique des modÃ¨les pour la simulation des flux de CO2.",

Cette augmentation est en partie liÃ©e Ã  l'intensification du mode annulaire austral (SAM), principal mode de variabilitÃ© atmosphÃ©rique au sud de 20Â°S. Dans cette thÃ¨se, on s'intÃ©resse Ã  comprendre les effets de la tendance positive du SAM sur les propriÃ©tÃ©s des masses d'eau formÃ©es dans la rÃ©gion de l'ACC.A cette fin, on met en place une stratÃ©gie de simulations rÃ©gionales couplÃ©es ocÃ©an-glace de mer et forcÃ©es par une sÃ©rie de scÃ©narios atmosphÃ©riques perturbÃ©s. Les scÃ©narios atmosphÃ©riques sont construits Ã  partir de rÃ©analyses atmosphÃ©riques afin de dÃ©crire les diffÃ©rentes composantes (dynamiques et thermodynamiques) des changements liÃ©s au SAM.En rÃ©ponse Ã  l'intensification du SAM, les simulations montrent une forte salinisation de la couche de mÃ©lange ocÃ©anique ainsi que des eaux modales (SAMW) et intermÃ©diaires (AAIW).L'essentiel de ces changements peut Ãªtre attribuÃ© aux composantes dynamiques du SAM.

    "genre": "phdthesis",
    "source": "tel.archives-ouvertes.fr",
    "abstract": "The next generation of climate models will include an ice-sheet model in order to improve the ice sheet mass balance projections by accounting for the ice dynamics and ice-oceans interactions. On the one hand, the Southern Ocean (SO) is indeed driving the acceleration of the Antarctic outlet glaciers via an increase in the basal melting of the ice shelves. On the other hand, the increasing ice discharge from Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) contributes to the current sea level rise and is likely to become the largest cryospheric contributor to sea level rise by the end of the current century. In addition, the related freshening may have significant implications on future sea-ice cover and on bottom water formation. However, it is not clear yet how the ocean and ice-sheet components of future coupled systems will account for the ice-ocean interactions, which are both causes and consequences of the AIS mass imbalance. Here in this work, different aspects of the standalone ocean and ice-sheet components have been investigated. A first step of this thesis has been focused in the representation of the glacial freshwater fluxes in current ocean models. Based on recent glaciological estimates, the ice shelf basal melting fluxes have been spatially distributed in an ORCA025 grid, and the calving rates have been applied into an improved version of the NEMO-ICB iceberg model. This preliminary study has been used to produce a monthly iceberg meltwater climatology, to be used to force current ocean models. This work shows the importance of representing the iceberg meltwater fluxes when modeling sea ice, which can be inexpensively achieve by using our climatology. The improvements in the representation of the glacial freshwater fluxes have been considered in the study of the ocean model response to the Antarctic mass imbalance. This study considers a realistic perturbation in the glacial freshwater forcing as close as possible as it will be represented in future ice-sheet/ocean models. According to our results, up to 50% of the recent Antarctic sea ice volume changes might be caused by the observed decadal AIS mass imbalance rate. Glacial freshwater forcing appears to be crucial to correctly represent the ice-ocean interactions and projecting sea ice cover of future coupled systems. However, the estimation of the glacial freshwater input in future climate models will be strongly dependent upon the capacity of ice-sheet models to reproduce the grounding line migrations of marine ice sheet glaciers. Current ice-sheet models present large uncertainties related to different parametrizations. In the context of the future climate models, we have studied the sensitivity of ocean-driven grounding line retreats to the application of two different friction laws and two different englacial stress approximations. The model responses almost indistinctively to either the SSA or the SSA* englacial stress approximations. However, differences in the contribution of the glacier to the sea level rise can be up to 50% depending on the friction law considered. The more physically constrained Schoof friction law is significantly more reactive to the ocean perturbations than Weertman law and should be considered in future coupled systems. This work underlines that uncertainties related to the ice sheet model estimates of grounding line migrations may not only contribute to uncertainties in sea level projections, but also the sea ice cover through the ice-ocean interaction in future ocean models.This conclusion suggests the need for improving the representation of both the ice shelf basal melting and the glacier interaction with the bedrock, in order to improve the climate projections of future climate models, in which the spatial and seasonal distribution of the glacial freshwater fluxes may play an important role in setting the sea ice cover.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of the ocean at a scale < 100km (fine-scales) is currently not well known. This is due to the lack of sufficient observational datasets at this scale-range in the ocean. There are suggestions from recent studies that classes of motions at this scale-range impacts the distribution and exchanges of kinetic energy in the ocean and that balanced submesoscale motions (<50km) and unbalanced internal gravity waves can play an active role in fluxing kinetic energy towards dissipative scales in the ocean. To better understand fine-scale motions, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite with the task of providing an unprecedented view of the ocean down to a wavelength of 10-15km is been assembled and expected for launch in 2021. In anticipation of SWOT, numerical ocean models capable of resolving fine-scales has been designed and implemented. In this study, we use three of these simulations to investigate (i) the spatial and temporal variability of oceanic eddies at fine-scales down to 10km scale, (ii) cross-scale kinetic energy exchanges at fine-scales in a regime of active submesoscale motions and (iii) in a regime of externally forced internal tides. Our results show that the distribution of oceanic eddies at spatial scale < 100km undergo strong seasonality and that this seasonality is as a result of an increased population of submesoscales eddies (10 - 50km) in wintertime. We found that submesoscale turbulence (a class of oceanic turbulence at fine-scale) is responsible for the increase in the distribution of submesoscales eddies in winter. Further analysis showed that submesoscale turbulence also affects the kinetic energy cascade by providing a route towards dissipation both at the surface and in the interior of the ocean. Interestingly, this cascade in the presence of externally forced internal tides is increased by a factor of 3 in summertime due to enhanced wave activity by tidal motions. Our analysis also shows that not accounting for the ageostrophic flows in the calculation of cross-scale kinetic energy exchanges might underestimate the true magnitude of the forward cascade of energy.",

    "abstract": "The first and most exhaustive work of its kind devoted entirely to the subject, Large Eddy Simulation presents a comprehensive account and a unified view of this young but very rich discipline. LES is the only efficient technique for approaching high Reynolds numbers when simulating industrial, natural or experimental configurations. The author concentrates on incompressible fluids and chooses his topics in treating with care both the mathematical ideas and their applications. The book addresses researchers as well as graduate students and engineers. The second edition was a greatly enriched version motivated both by the increasing theoretical interest in LES and the increasing number of applications. Two entirely new chapters were devoted to the coupling of LES with multiresolution multidomain techniques and to the new hybrid approaches that relate the LES procedures to the classical statistical methods based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. This 3rd edition adds various sections to the text such as a careful error analysis of filtered density function models and multiscale models. It also contains two new chapters dealing with the mathematical representations of LES and the prediction of active and passive scalar dynamics, which are of considerable interest for engineering and geophysical modeling. The part on geophysical flow has much to offer on a critical current issue. To quote from the foreword to the third edition written by Charles Meneveau: \"... this meticulously assembled and significantly enlarged description of the many aspects of LES will be a most welcome addition to the bookshelves of scientists and engineers in fluid mechanics, LES practitioners, and students of turbulence in general.\"",
